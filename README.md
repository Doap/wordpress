DevOps and Platforms wordpress
=========

WordPress is a state-of-the-art publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability. This is a sync of the trunk branch of the WordPress Subversion repository.  Since WordPress doesn't use Git for its primary version control system, do not send pull requests. File a bug at http://core.trac.wordpres.org/ instead and post your patch there.
